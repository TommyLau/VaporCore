# Steam SDK Coding Standard for Cursor

This file defines the coding standards for developing a Steam API emulator in C++, ensuring alignment with the Steamworks SDK's style and conventions. It provides rules for naming, code structure, C++ practices, and Cursor AI behavior to maintain consistency and compatibility.

## Project Context
- **Objective**: Develop a C++ emulator for the Steamworks SDK, replicating its API (e.g., `ISteamUser`, `ISteamFriends`) for testing or standalone use.
- **Target**: Code should mimic Steam SDK's C++ style, be thread-safe, and integrate seamlessly with game loops.
- **Language**: C++11 (minimum, for broad compatibility with Steamworks' supported compilers: VS2008+, GCC 4.6+, Clang 3.0+).

## C++ Coding Standards

### Language Features
- Use C++11 features (e.g., `auto`, `nullptr`, `std::unique_ptr`) for modern, safe code.
- Avoid C++17 or later unless explicitly required (e.g., `std::filesystem`), to match Steam's conservative compatibility.
- Prefer RAII for resource management (e.g., `std::lock_guard`, `std::unique_ptr`).
- Use `std::function` or function pointers for callbacks, emulating Steam's `STEAM_CALLBACK` macro.

### Memory Management
- Use `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr` for dynamic memory; avoid raw pointers (`T*`) for ownership.
- For C-style API compatibility (e.g., `steam_api_flat.h`), use raw pointers only in `extern "C"` interfaces, with clear ownership documentation.

### Thread Safety
- Ensure thread-safe callback dispatching, mimicking `SteamAPI_RunCallbacks`.
- Use `std::mutex` for simple synchronization; `std::recursive_mutex` for recursive locking scenarios (e.g., nested API calls).
- Document thread-safety assumptions in public API functions.

### Error Handling
- Return `bool` for initialization functions (e.g., `SteamAPI_Init` returns `true` on success).
- Use enum-based error codes (e.g., `ESteamErrorCode`) for detailed failure reporting, matching Steam's style.
- Avoid exceptions in core API paths for performance and compatibility with game loops.

### Performance
- Optimize for game loop integration: minimize allocations and heavy operations in callback or API calls.
- Use inline functions for small, frequently called API getters (e.g., `SteamUser()->GetSteamID()`).

## Naming Conventions
The Steam SDK uses a consistent, readable naming style. Follow these rules to align with `steam_api.h` and related headers.

- **Classes and Structs**:
  - Use PascalCase with a prefix: `Steam_` for core classes emulation, `ISteam` for interfaces (e.g., `Steam_User`, `ISteamFriends`).
- **Functions**:
  - Use PascalCase with verb-noun patterns (e.g., `GetPlayerSteamID`, `RequestUserStats`).
  - Global API functions mimic Steam's style (e.g., `SteamAPI_Init`, `SteamUser()`).
- **Variables**:
  - Use camelCase for local variables (e.g., `userId`, `appId`, `timeStamp`, `currentTime`).
  - Member variables use camelCase with a trailing underscore (e.g., `m_steamId_`, `m_appId_`, `m_logFile`, `m_enabled`).
  - Constants use `k_ConstantName` (e.g., `k_unAppIdInvalid`, `k_nSteamUserMaxNameLength`).
- **Enums**:
  - Use PascalCase with a prefix (e.g., `ESteamErrorCode`, `ESteamUserStatType`).
  - Enum values use `k_E` prefix (e.g., `k_EErrorNone`, `k_EUserNotLoggedIn`).
- **Macros**:
  - Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` with `VAPORCORE_` prefix for emulator-specific macros (e.g., `VAPORCORE_STEAM_CALLBACK`).
- **Namespaces**:
  - Do not use namespace

## Code Structure

### File Organization
- Use `.h` for headers, `.cpp` for implementations.
- Header files must include guards: `VAPORCORE_<FILENAME>_H` (e.g., `VAPORCORE_STEAM_USER_H`).
- Group functionality by module (e.g., `steam_user.h/cpp` for `ISteamUser`, `steam_friends.h/cpp` for `ISteamFriends`).
- Include directives:
  - Standard libraries: `#include <library>` (e.g., `#include <cstdint>`).
  - Steam SDK interface files: `#include <file.h>` (e.g., `#include <isteamclient.h>`).
  - Project files: `#include "file.h"` (e.g., `#include "vapor_base.h"`).
  - Sort includes alphabetically, with standard libraries first, Steam SDK files second, then the project files.

### Code Formatting
- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces (compact, common in game dev).
- **Braces**: Place opening brace on the same line (e.g., `void Func() {}`).
- **Line Length**: Limit to 100 characters.
- **Spacing**:
  - One space around operators (e.g., `x = y + z`).
  - No space between function name and parentheses (e.g., `GetSteamID()`).
- **Comments**:
  - Use `//` for single-line comments.
  - Use `/* */` for multi-line or Doxygen-style API documentation:
    ```cpp
    // Gets the current user's Steam ID.
    // @return The 64-bit Steam ID.
    uint64 GetPlayerSteamID() const;
    ```
- **Boolean Values**: Use `true`/`false`, not `1`/`0`.

## Steam SDK-Specific Conventions
- **App ID Handling**:
  - Read `steam_appid.txt` for development App ID, as Steam does when not launched via client.
  - Use `uint32` for App IDs (e.g., `k_unAppIdInvalid = 0`).
- **Callback System**:
  - Emulate `STEAM_CALLBACK` with a C++ class or `std::function`.
  - Support manual dispatch (`SteamAPI_ManualDispatch_Init`) and automatic callbacks.
  - Example game loop integration:
    ```cpp
    while (running) {
      RunCallbacks();
      // Game logic
    }
    ```
- **Interface Access**:
  - Provide singleton-like accessors (e.g., `Steam_User::GetInstance()` returns `Steam_User*`).
  - Use `ISteam` prefix for interface classes (e.g., `ISteamUser`).
- **Flat API**:
  - Offer C-style flat API with `extern "C"` for interoperability (e.g., `SteamAPI_GetPlayerSteamID()`).
  - Use plain types (`uint64`, `const char*`) in flat API signatures.
- **Types**:
  - Use `uint64` for Steam IDs (`CSteamID` in Steam SDK).
  - Use `uint32` for App IDs, game IDs, and other numeric identifiers.
  - Define `HSteamUser`, `HSteamPipe` as `uint32` for compatibility.

## Cursor AI Directives
- **Code Generation**:
  - Generate C++ code adhering to these naming, formatting, and style rules.
  - Ensure public API functions match Steamworks signatures (consult Steamworks API Reference).
- **Suggestions**:
  - Prioritize Steam-like patterns (e.g., `ISteamUser` methods, `k_E` enum values).
  - Avoid non-C++ frameworks (e.g., Boost, Qt) unless requested.
- **Refactoring**:
  - Preserve Steam SDK naming (e.g., don't rename `GetPlayerSteamID` to `get_player_id`).
- **Verification**:
  - Cross-check generated code against Steamworks API Reference or `steam_api.h`.
  - Ensure thread-safety in callback and API implementations.
- **Error Avoidance**:
  - Never use raw pointers for ownership in C++ code (use smart pointers).
  - Never suggest linking against `steam_api.dll` for emulator code.
  - Never generate non-C++ code for core emulator logic.

```

## Absolute Requirements
- **MUST** use `std::` for standard library types (e.g., `std::string`, not `string`).
- **MUST** ensure `extern "C"` for flat API functions.
- **MUST NOT** use actual Steamworks SDK libraries in emulator code.
- **MUST NOT** generate Python, Java, or other non-C++ code for emulator logic.
